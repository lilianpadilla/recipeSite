          Caldo de Res, or Mexican beef soup, which is a healthy and budget-friendly soup made with a flavorful beef broth and squash, corn, carrots, cabbage and potatoes. I love Mexican food the most, so this website will feature some common Mexican meals.

          I had to actually cook since this school year I live in City Vista, so I have a kitchen to make my own meals. I usually cook dinner with my other roommates who are more experienced in cooking and I ask them lots of questions so I do not mess up.
